##  Data Science End to End Project: The development of a comprehensive water quality monitoring and prediction system.

#### Introduction
This README file provides an overview of a  Data Science project plan focused on the development of a comprehensive water quality monitoring and prediction system. The initial dataset used for this project consisted of 16 features and 349440 rows

#### Dataset Information
- Univariate: dataset involves observations or samples with one target variable.
- Subject Area: environment, healthcare, public health, sustainability.
- Feature Type: float and boolean.

#### Project Objectives
The primary objectives of this project is to predict the drinkability of water in real time.

- Water Potability Classification: Predict the potability of water based on various water quality parameters 
- Data Exploration: Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the distribution, patterns, and relationships within the dataset.
- Visualization: Implement a visualization tool to present the insights.

#### Data Source and Composition

#### Planning of the project
** STAGE 1
1. Acquire the dataset.
2. Download the dataset from the source.
3. Verify the dataset format and structure.
4. Load the dataset into a data frame (e.g., pandas DataFrame in Python).

** STAGE 2
1. Data preprocessing.
      Handle missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies.
2. Explore basic statistics and distributions of variables.
3. Formulate hypotheses for further analysis.


** STAGE 3
1. Plot histograms for numerical variables to understand their distributions.
2. Create bar charts for variables.
3. Create several classification models and cross validate to check for accuracy
4. Work on visualizations and getting insights.


** STAGE 4 
1. Make conclusions.
2. Work on the presentation.
3. Prepare for presentation.
